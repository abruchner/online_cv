		<h2>My Background.</h2>
		<div class="skill-row">
			<img class="engineer-pic" src="pics/engineer_2.png" alt="engineer-pic">
			<h3>Civil Engineering</h3>
			<p>I studied civil engineering at the University of Applied Sciences in Nuremberg
				and graduated in 2004 as <b>civil engineer</b>. One year later this type of study
				had changed and was offered as either a Bachelor or a Master study. So I am one
				of the last 'Dipl.Ing.(FH)'.
				My strategic focus was on construction operation, which emphasized the topics of
				calculations, resource planning, project management and building law.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="skill-row">
			<img class="fm-pic" src="pics/fm_2.png" alt="fm-pic">
			<h3>Facility Management</h3>
			<p>Two years after finishing my first study, I did extra-occupational my <b>Masters</b>
				degree in <b>Facility Management</b>. This covered all FM related topics like technical
				FM, operational FM, infrastructural FM, CAFM, quality management, benchmarking,
				space management, etc. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="skill-row">
			<img class="business-man-pic" src="pics/calculation_1.png" alt="business-management-pic">
			<h3>Business Manager</h3>
			<p>Finally, I did another study, called <b>Business Management for Engineers</b>, which
				covered similar topics as my other two studies, but also included industrial accounting,
				investments and financing, logistics, labor legislation, contract law, competition law
				and marketing.</p>

			<h3>SERENDIPITYREMIX, since 2018</h3>
			<p>I joined Serendipityremix in 2018 as <b>Senior Facility Management Specialist</b>.
				My projects are very versatile and I learned a lot during my time there.
				Our biggest project was for a church group. For approximately 1.5 years we did building
				condition assessments for about 200 churches all over South Africa, including
				short-, mid- and long term maintenance budgets and proposed a FM strategy.
				For six months I also joined another project to develop a Facility Management Strategy
				for the City of Tshwane / Pretoria.
				I also had a hospital project for a big hospital in Durban, for which an assessment
				of the structure, building fabric and costs for the whole lifecycle were required. </p>

			<h3>NERA GROUP, 2017</h3>
			<p>At Nera, which was a start-up, I was employed as <b>Director Facilities</b>. My job
				was doing FM hospital assessments, which included the building
				structures, as well as the FM services. The hospitals were middle-class hospitals in
				South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, Tunesia and Morocco. We provided FM reports containing the
				assessments and recommendations for FM services and maintenance. These included for
				example proposing outsourcing platforms or bundling of activities, change of contracts,
				purchasing more energy efficient equipment, etc. We also targeted Health and Safety
				concerns.</p>

			<h3>SIEMENS (PTY) LTD, 2013-2016</h3>
			<p>I joined Siemens South Africa as a delegate in 2013 and was employed as
				<b>Head of Assetmanagement Africa</b>, responsible for all Real Estate assets that
					Siemens had on the African continent. The properties were mainly in South Africa,
					Nigeria, Morocco and Tunisia, with some additional smaller offices in other countries
					like Ghana or Mozambique. The portfolio consisted of production/assembly facilities and
					offices. Our main focus was on reducing owned space by selling assets (sometimes with
					lease-back optione) or consolidating facilities. In the Head Office we refurbished
					the entrance area, the canteen, implemented a kindergarden and reduced the energy
					consumption for cooling systems with the installation of ice containers on the roofs. </p>

			<h3>SIEMENS AG, 2012</h3>
			<p>After participating in the European Junior Talent Circle, an internal development
				program for Siemens employees (under 30) with management experience, I was promoted to
				<b>Head of Location Management Erlangen</b> and my responsibilities moved towards
				office buildings. I did not stay very long in this position, as the opportunity of
				going abroad knocked on the door nearly at the same time. I had always wanted to work
				and live in another country and to meet and work with people from other cultures and with
				different backgrounds.</p>

			<h3>SIEMENS AG, 2004-2012</h3>
			<p>I joined the production facility of Automation and Drives already as working student
				doing AutoCad plans. Over the time I took over more and more responsibilities and was
				taken over as <b>Team Member Facility Management</b>after I had finished my studies.
				The location was about 200,000 sqm in size and had twelve production halls, in which large
				drives and control cabinets in various sizes were manufactured and tested for ships,
				trains, paper mills, mining trucks, etc.
				In 2007 I took over the <b>Head of Facility Management</b> position and in 2010 I
				was moved to Siemens Real Estate due to a reorganization in the company. I was then
				<b>Location Manager</b>, still at the same site, but more in the role of 'owner' of the
				location and dealing with my previous working colleagues as 'tenants'.
				My area of responsibility on the site changed over the years. While in the first years
				I was very much involved in project management (planning, tendering, calculations) of
				changes to buildings, maintenance topics or machine foundations / production relocations,
				from 2010 onwards I took on more managerial tasks including people management, location
				strategies and especially financial topics like forcasting and budgeting.</p>

			<h3>My Cocker Spaniel Paul</h3>
			<p>Paul is my 7.5 year old Cocker Spaniel. He is with me since he was only three months old.
				I love him to bits. His favorite hobbies are swimming and fetching balls or sticks, but going
				for a walk or run can barely be topped by anything else. It is because of him that I started
				running, especially trail running. We love being outside together to explore nature and new
				routes and to compete every now and then against other dogs and owners in specific events.</p>

			<h3>Cycling</h3>
			<p>I have always loved cycling, but unfortunately the weather in Germany was never too
				supportive of this hobby. This changed when I came to South Africa. Especially road
				cycling caught my attention, but I also like mountainbiking, if it is not too technical.
				I even won two stage races with my cycling-partner and the biggest tour was a 2 week tour
				from the North to the South of Portugal (1,000 km) in 2018. As there happened more and more accidents with
				cyclists on the South African roads, I got a gravel bike, which is the perfect mixture
				between road bike and mountainbike. I can ride on the roads and quickly jump off on the
				gravel, if I feel uncomfortable. In the meantime I have a collection of four bikes.</p>

			<h3>Programming</h3>
			<p>While we all sat at home during the Covid-19-lockdown, I started spending time with
				programming languages. I started off with swift/x-code for iOs apps, and slowly grew
				into python3. In parallel I checked out webdevelopment and webdesign, too, just to realize,
				that it is not done with HTML, I also needed CSS, Java, Bootstrap, Flask and many,
				many others. So this will keep me busy for still some time. But it is fun and I enjoy
				it and will do so even more once I can do my own projects. There are still more courses
				like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and so much more ...</p>
